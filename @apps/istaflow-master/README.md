Istaflow is automation app built for pythonista. This has been inspired by workflow for iOS you can find it here [Workflow](https://workflow.is)

You create flows to run flows. Each flow is made up of a series of elements. These elements have a single purpose and are reusable across flows.

Istaflow currently can run basic flows currently with simple validation for an input to each element. 

This has been built with pythonista 1.6 beta and has only had slight testing in 1.5, so no guarantees that it works on 1.5 or 1.6 either
