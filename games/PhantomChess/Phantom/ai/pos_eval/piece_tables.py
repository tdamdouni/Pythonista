"""Piece-square tables.  Ratings based on the postion of a piece and it's type.
This file is import clean.

The idea behind the lists in this file is to represent a chessboard.  Each list with in a list is 8 pieces long
and each 'main' list is 8 lists long.  This means there are 64 elements total in each list.  Those elements
are the ratings of the squares for the piece type (that the list is named for).  For example, a white pawn at
the coordinate (3, 3) will recieve a bonus of 20 points.
